# Voice-To-Text-project
Developed a desktop Voice-to-Text application using Tauri and React that records user audio and converts it into text using the Deepgram Speech-to-Text API. The application supports start/stop recording, microphone access, and displays accurate transcription in a simple and user-friendly interface.
